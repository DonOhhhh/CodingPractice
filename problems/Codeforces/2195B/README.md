# [Codeforces 2195B : Heapify 1](https://codeforces.com/contest/2195/problem/B)

## 문제 설명

You are given a permutation a of length $n^{\text{∗}}$.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Select an index i ($1 \le i \le \frac{n}{2}$), and swap $a_i$ and $a_{2i}$.
For example, when a=[1,4,2,3,5], you can swap $a_2$ and $a_4$ to make it [1,3,2,4,5], but you cannot swap $a_2$ and $a_3$.

Please determine if the sequence a can be sorted in increasing order.

$^{\text{∗}}A$ permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

## 입력

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The second line of each test case contains n distinct integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le n)$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 출력

If a can be sorted in increasing order, output "YES" on a separate line. Otherwise, output "NO" on a separate line.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.

## 노트

In the first test case, a is [1,4,3,2,5]. You can sort a in increasing order by swapping $a_2$ and $a_4$. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

In the second test case, a is [1,4,2,3,5]. It is impossible to sort a in increasing order. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
