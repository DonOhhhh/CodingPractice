# [Codeforces 2195F : Parabola Independence](https://codeforces.com/contest/2195/problem/F)

## 문제 설명

You are given a set of n quadratic functions $F=\{f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_n \}$, where $f_i(x)=a_i x^2 + b_i x + c_i$.

Two functions f and g are called independent if $f(x) \neq g(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Also, a set of functions $G=\{g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}$ is called organized if the two functions $g_i$ and $g_j$ are independent for all $1 \le i \lt j \le |G|$.

For each $i=1,2,\ldots,n,$ please find the size of the largest organized subset of F that contains $f_i$ as an element.

## 입력

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n ($1 \le n \le 3000$).

Each of the n following lines contains three integers $a_i, b_i, c_i$ denoting the function $f_i (-10^6 \le a_i, b_i, c_i \le 10^6, a_i \neq 0)$.

It is guaranteed that the functions in one test case are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $3000^2$.

## 출력

For each test case, output $n$ integers $s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n,$ where $s_i$ is the size of the largest organized subset that contains $f_i$.

## 노트

In the first test case, the functions are as follows:

- $f_1(x)=x^2+2x-1;$
- $f_2(x)=-3x^2-3;$
- $f_3(x)=-x^2+4x-5;$
- $f_4(x)=x^2+2x-4.$

The functions' graphs are as shown below:

The largest organized subsets of F containing each function are as follows:

- $\{f_1,f_3,f_4\}$ is the largest organized subset that contains $f_1;$
- $\{f_1,f_2\}$ is the largest organized subset that contains $f_2;$
- $\{f_1,f_3,f_4\}$ is the largest organized subset that contains $f_3;$
- $\{f_1,f_3,f_4\}$ is the largest organized subset that contains $f_4.$
